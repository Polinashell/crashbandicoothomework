Crash Bandicoot is a fast-paced platformer where the player controls a character running through a level, jumping over obstacles, avoiding traps, and collecting apples. The main mechanics are jumping and dodging.
For the paper prototype, I decided to test the obstacle-jumping mechanic with the ability to collect power-ups, as it's key to the game and determines how engaged the player is.

Mechanics: jumping over obstacles and collecting apples.
This reflects the moment-to-moment action in the game.
It balances risk (losing lives from TNT) and reward (apples, points).
Additional rule: if a player collects 100 apples, they receive +1 life.

The prototype is a track divided into squares. On some squares:
TNT (traps) - the player loses 1 life.
Apples (bonuses) - the player gains +1 point.
The player starts with 3 lives and 0 points.

Test Rules
The player places a token at the beginning of the track.
Rolls the dice:
1–3 - step forward one space.
4–6 - jump one space.
TNT - minus 1 life.
Apple - plus 1 point (if you score 100 points - plus 1 life).
The game continues until the player reaches the finish line or loses all lives.
